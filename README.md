# React + TypeScript + Vite

All tasks were completed (excluding extra tasks), but the search task was completed somewhat incorrectly. The track list is implemented using a table, so I decided to search by each column. For the genre and artist columns, the filter result is sent with the corresponding keys in the request, and the filter results of all other columns are sent with the search key. Only one value can be sent in the search parameter, so the set field filter is automatically reset when setting a filter to another field. I understand that this is not correct (since the search searches the entire track object). In general, in my case, the search can be used in all columns (the search will be performed not by the column key, but by the entire track object), except for the artist and genre columns.
